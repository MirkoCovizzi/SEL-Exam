IPC demo program based on message queue
-----------------------------------------

- within the file platform_config.h the user needs to specify the system configuration. 


The user can specifiy:


* the size of the message and command buffers

* the priority of the interrupt associated with the IPC communication

* the memory locations of the M0 code/data, location of the IPC queues
	


The linker scatter file needs to be consistent with the provided ROM/RAM addresses in case of changes. 


- the application runs completely from RAM and exchanges messages between the processors, showing how to post and read from the queue.
